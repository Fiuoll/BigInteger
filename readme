Hello!
This program can compute simple operations like +, -, * with big integer values.
Several method was realized:
1 - BigInt class -- vector of digits of value with operations +, -, *
2 - ModUInt class -- vector of reminder of division by prime values; prime values can be specified from file or can be computed several first prime numbers; operations +, *
3 - ModUInt with OpenCL -- parallel realization 
0 - all previous methods

Input:
<value> <operation> <value>
For example:
1 + 1
99999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999 * 9999999999999999999999999999

Compile:
g++ ./*.cpp -lOpenCL
